<h3>
I
<br><br>
THE MOUNTAINEER PEOPLE
</h3>

<p>
Both of Flying Plover's parents
had died when he was a little baby,
and ever since&mdash;for six long
years&mdash;he had lived with his
grandmother.  The old woman's name
was Squat-by-the-fire.  She was the
wisest person in the tribe, in spite
of the fact that an old man who
lived in another village said that he
knew twice as much as anybody
else in the whole world.  She was
deep in medicine and history and
story-telling.  She could paint fine
pictures on bark and cured skins,
and was skilful in the carving of
wonderful little figures in wood
and bone and walrus ivory.  She
knew so much, and looked so
wise, and had such bright eyes,
that many of the tribesmen
believed that she was a magician.
</p>

<p>
The tribe that Flying Plover
and his grandmother belonged to
lived far north, in that bleak and
unexplored country called
Labrador.  They spent the summer
months near the coast, where they
fished in the great bays for cod
and seals, and in the rivers for
salmon and trout.  They traded
with the few white settlers and
missionaries, and with the
Eskimo people.  At the approach
of winter they traveled inland,
with the great herds of caribou,
into the sheltered valleys of the
mountains.  As the winter is a
much longer season than the
summer, in that country, these people
spent the greater part of every year
in the mountain forests&mdash;and so
they are called the Mountaineer
Indians, or the Mountaineers.  But
this book is not about the tribe,
but is full of the stories that old
Squat-by-the-fire told to little
Flying Plover, in the long winter
evenings.
</p>

<p>
<i>You</i> can not sit by the old
woman's fire, and smell the herbs
she was always steeping, and play
with the little figures which she
carved so cleverly, as Flying
Plover could; yet I hope you will
like her stories, for all that.

<h3>
II
<br><br>
THE BEAR, THE MOOSE, AND THE WALRUS
</h3>

<p>
The other children of the village
were afraid of Flying Plover's
grandmother, because of her bent
back, and wrinkled face, and bright
dark eyes.  Though she had never
so much as said a harsh word to any
one of them, and though her medicines
had saved the lives of many of
them, yet they would never follow
Flying Plover into the big lodge
where she sat all day by the fire,
steeping her fragrant herbs and
thinking of all manner of wonderful
things.  They said that she
could turn a little boy, or a little
girl, into any kind of animal or
bird in the world, without any more
trouble than snapping her fingers.
That was nonsense; but some of
the men and women believed it,
too.  Magicians were not very rare
things in that region (at least to
people who believed in them) and
you were just as likely as not to
think that you saw one every time
you went out for a walk.  But
Squat-by-the-fire was not a magician,
and could not have turned a
little boy, or a little girl, into a bird
or a four-legged animal if she had
snapped her fingers for fifty years.
She was just an old, good, and very
clever woman; and though she
loved little children and was glad
to be able to make medicines for
them, she really was not sorry that
they did not all run in and out of
her lodge, with the freedom of her
grandson.  Flying Plover had
learned her ways and wishes and
never disturbed the pots by the fire
or the big jars in the corner; but
she knew that the other children,
once they felt at home, would
knock things about at a terrible
rate.  And she was far too old and
busy to begin to teach deportment
to all the children of the village.
But Flying Plover never caused
her any trouble, and was not in the
least afraid of her.
</p>

<p>
One evening, when the raw-hide
door of the lodge was fastened
tight, and the fire burned cheerily
and smokily on the earthen floor,
and the wind moaned outside, the
old medicine woman asked, "What
games did you play to-day, little
son of Swift Runner?"
</p>

<p>
"We played at battles," replied
Flying Plover; "and they put me
on the Eskimo side, and so I was
taken prisoner, and fastened to a
tree.  I did not see much fun in
that; so I made up another game,
something like deer-hunting, and
we played that until it got dark.
But I like battles best, except when
I am an Eskimo.  Do the Eskimos
always get beaten in the real
battles?"
</p>

<p>
"Our people have not been at
war with the fat blubber-eaters for
a long, long time," replied the old
woman.  "We used to battle with
them every summer; but it was a
foolish thing to do, and brought a
great deal of sorrow and suffering
to both peoples.  When my father
was a young man, our warriors
used to chase the Eskimo warriors
as the timber wolves chase the
young caribou.  But the missionaries
have taught us that killing
and robbing are terrible sins&mdash;and
I think people should have
known that before.  So now, when
we want sealskins and fish, we do
not fight and rob, but we trade
instead.  That is better, for it does
not call for the shedding of blood,
the burning of lodges, and torture
and starvation, as of old.  Now
the blubber-eaters are a weak
people; but hundreds and hundreds of
seasons ago they were a great
nation.  But that was far beyond
the reach of my father's memory.
They were a mighty people though,
once upon a time; and then our
nation was nothing more than a
few weak villages.  We were afraid
of the blubber-eaters then, and
never went down from the
mountains.  The Eskimo warriors
chased our warriors then, when
they saw them, even as the timber
wolves chase the young caribou.
So it is with men and tribes and
nations, little son of a chief.  I
have seen something of it, even
with my own eyes.  The Eskimo
people were the great people; and
next the Mountaineers were mighty
in battle; and now both the fat men
of the ice and the hunters of the
mountains know that the white
missionaries and the white traders
are their masters."
</p>

<p>
"That is very strange," remarked
Flying Plover.  "The white men
do not look like great warriors, and
they are very few in number."
</p>

<p>
"It is the mind," said old
Squat-by-the-fire, touching her wrinkled
forehead with a gnarled finger.
"'T is the light inside the skull that
gives the mastery; though to listen
to the story tellers, one would
believe that all the power lies in the
biggest club and the straightest
arrow.  The minds of the white
men are full of knowledge, and
caution, and courage.  That is why
they are now the great people."
</p>

<p>
"They feed their brains with
fine sweet puddings.  I think that
is why they are able to talk to our
people so big and make the little
Eskimo boys go to school," said
Flying Plover.
</p>

<p>
The old woman laughed; but it
was not at her grandson's remark.
She was thinking of the oldest
story she had ever heard.
</p>

<p>
"There was a time, more than
ten thousand summers ago, I should
think, when men were such weak,
dull-witted creatures that they had
no mastery over anything but the
smallest animals and birds," she
said.  "Oh, yes, that was a very
long time ago, ages and ages
before the white man had ever been
heard of.  The animals were the
masters, in those days, and it is a
wonder that the poor, frightened
creatures that ran on two legs, and
hid in caves and holes, kept alive
at all.  Then, the wolves were as
big as black bears, and the bears
stood as high as caribou, and the
foxes were as big as timber wolves.
When a hunter saw a fox, in those
days, he was glad to climb a tree;
and he was lucky if a caribou did
not come along and knock the tree
over with its head.  Or may be an
eagle would catch sight of the man,
and swoop down and pick him out
of the tree with its claws, as if he
weighed no more than a little brook
trout."
</p>

<p>
"I am glad I did not live in
those days," said Flying Plover.
"If all the beasts were too big to
kill, and there were no white men to
buy blankets from, what did people
do for clothes to wear?"
</p>

<p>
"There were the hares," replied
the old woman.  "They were six
times as large as they are now, but
not much more dangerous unless
they were cornered.  And sometimes
the bravest hunters managed
to kill a beaver or a musquash.
Even the mice were well worth
hunting in those days, and one fat
mouse made a very good dinner
for a small family.  Oh, it was a
queer world, you may be sure!"
</p>

<p>
Old Squat-by-the-fire ceased her
talk for a little while and opened a
leathern bag at her belt.  From it
she drew a wooden pipe, a knife,
and a plug of dark-brown trade
tobacco.  Soon the pipe was filled
and lit, and the blue smoke curling
about her head.
</p>

<p>
"Did they have any tobacco in
those days?" asked Flying Plover.
</p>

<p>
"No&mdash;nor fire to light it with,"
replied his grandmother.
</p>

<p>
The little boy was greatly
astonished at that, and could not
think how people warmed themselves
in winter, or cooked their
dinner.  He was just opening his
mouth to ask about a dozen
questions, when the old
medicine-woman, noticing it, hurried on
with her talk.

<br>
&quot;He left his hiding-place and chased the bear&quot;
</p>

<p>
"The king of the frozen north
was a great walrus.  His tusks
were as long as a canoe paddle
and his head as big as this lodge.
He lived in a house built of
icebergs, and was not afraid of
anything in the world.  This country
had two kings.  One was a white
bear, as big as a trading schooner,
and the other was a bull moose as
tall as the highest spruce tree in
the forest.  When the moose was
without his horns he went far
away to the westward and hid
himself in a deep valley&mdash;and
then the white bear was king of
all this country.  But every year,
as soon as the moose felt that his
horns were full-grown again, he
left his hiding-place and chased
the bear hundreds of miles out of
his kingdom.  So they went on,
year after year, until, at last, King
Walrus heard about it.  Being a
walrus he did not like white bears.
The dislike was born in him, for,
of course, he had never had any
trouble with bears himself.
</p>

<p>
"'I have no doubt that the moose
is the rightful ruler of that country,'
he said.  'I'll just make a journey
into that region and set the matter
right.'
</p>

<p>
"Of course what he really
meant was that he would take the
country for himself.  He was
growing ambitious.  He felt that
such a mighty chief should rule the
whole world.  So one fine day in
winter, just after King Bear had
sent King Moose trotting westward
to his hidden valley to grow
a new pair of horns, up waddled
King Walrus.  The bear was five
times as large as white bears are
now; but old King Walrus was
ten times the size of the walruses
of to-day.  King Bear saw at a
glance that he was not big enough
to fight with his unexpected visitor.
Knowing that all walruses are the
enemies of all bears, he did not
have to think very hard to find a
reason for the northern king's visit.
His eyes grew red as the fire with
the anger that burned in his brain;
but what he said was, 'I am highly
honored and unspeakably delighted
at seeing you in my poor country.'
</p>

<p>
"'Hump,' grunted King Walrus,&mdash;for
his manners were no better
than the manners of any other
walrus, and, into the bargain, he
was quite short of breath from his
overland journey in from the coast.
King Bear saw that his only
chance of keeping things pleasant
was in being polite.  He would
give his visitor some valuable gifts,
too.
</p>

<p>
"'This is an unexpected pleasure,'
he continued.  'I was never
so honored before in all my life.
I am deeply moved by your condescension.'
</p>

<p>
"By this time King Walrus had
recovered enough breath to talk
with.  'You will be moved still
farther before very long,' he said.
Then he laughed roaringly, for he
had a very coarse sense of humor
and enjoyed nobody's jokes but
his own.  The bear was bright
enough, you may be sure, and
usually approved of jokes, but he
did not laugh that time.  He
became so angry that he forgot all
his caution.
</p>

<p>
"'What are you bellowing about,
old blubber-sides?' he snarled.
</p>

<p>
"'Hey!  What was that you
called me?' roared King Walrus,
changing his tune very quickly.
</p>

<p>
"'You may bellow as loud as you
choose,' replied the bear, 'but you
can't frighten me with noise.'
</p>

<p>
"He was so angry that he was
utterly reckless.  White bears have
very hot tempers, as you know.
</p>

<p>
"'I called you old blubber-sides,'
he continued.  'I'll call you worse
names than that, if you don't go
away from my country.  You
smell like rotten fish!  Go away!
Go away!'
</p>

<p>
"King Walrus was far too angry
to reply to these insults in words.
His great sides shook with anger
as the sea shakes with storm.
Like a mountain lurching from its
place, he floundered after King
Bear at the top of his speed,
bellowing all the while like summer
thunder.  The earth groaned and
trembled&mdash;and King Bear ran like
a frightened hare.  He ran all day
and all night; and not until then
did the bellowing of old King
Walrus fall to silence behind him.
Then he sat down and growled
and groaned and snarled, so
enraged was he at finding himself an
outcast from his own country.  At
last he became quieter and began
to use his wits.
</p>

<p>
"'Old blubber-sides is too big for
me,' he said&mdash;'and I think the
Moose will find the same trouble,
when he gets back.  But here is a
country that does not look as if
anyone governed it.  I'll be king of
this country.'
</p>

<p>
"It was a very dreary looking
land in which the big white bear
now found himself.  He had
never seen it before; and he had
run so fast and so blindly that he
really did not know by what course
he had come or in what part of the
world he was.  He went to the
top of a hill and looked all around
him.  Nowhere was there any sign
of woods or water or sea-ice.  On
every side, and right away to the
edge of the sky, lay rounded,
treeless hills and wide, dreary barrens
all covered with snow.  The sight
made the bear feel dreadfully
grumpy, for nowhere could be seen
any movement of life&mdash;any promise
of dinner.  And he was so
hungry, after his long run, that his
stomach felt as if it contained a
lump of ice."

III
<br><br>
ADVENTURES OF KING BEAR CONTINUED
</h3>

<p>
Old Squat-by-the-fire ceased her
talking and, with tender care,
knocked the ashes out of her pipe
into the palm of her left hand.
She gazed narrowly at the ashes,
before blowing them into the fire.
</p>

<p>
"That was good tobacco," she
said.  "Every little bit of it turned
into smoke.  Indian tobacco was
not so good; but just to think that
there once was a time when people
didn't have any fire, even to light
their pipes and warm their bones
at.  That must have been much
worse than not having any tobacco."
</p>

<p>
"Or to cook their dinners at,"
said little Flying Plover.  The old
woman nodded.  Her bright eyes
were on the fire, and she was deep
in meditation.  Flying Plover
watched her in silence for fully
two minutes.  Then he said, "I
think King Bear was in King
Walrus's country."
</p>

<p>
"You are wrong.  But it is time
for you to go to bed," said Squat-by-the-fire.
</p>

<p>
"I am not sleepy.  Please tell
me some more about King Bear,"
begged the little boy.
</p>

<p>
"Well," said the old woman,
"he stood on the top of the hill and
growled and roared, just as loud as
he could, to see if anything would
hear him and come to find out his
trouble.  Presently a crow
appeared out of the gray sky, and
alighted on the snow.
</p>

<p>
"'You are making a horrible
noise,' said the crow.  'What's
the matter with you?'
</p>

<p>
"'I am hungry,' replied the bear.
'Who is king of this country?'
</p>

<p>
"'We have no king.  This
country is ruled by the people,'
said the bird.
</p>

<p>
"'Oh!' remarked King Bear,
and scratched his ear.  He had
never in all his life heard of a
country without a chief or a king.
'It looks like a poor sort of place.
Where are the people?'
</p>

<p>
"'Here come a few of them
now,' said the crow, turning his
head over his shoulder.  Sure
enough, there were six wolves and
two black bears approaching the
hill at a fast run.
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-024"></a>
<br>
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-024.jpg" alt="&quot;'Here come a few of them now,' said the crow&quot;">
<br>
&quot;'Here come a few of them now,' said the crow&quot;
</p>

<p>
"'They don't seem to be at all
afraid of me,' said King Bear,
gruffly.  'And yet I am big
enough to kill them all with one
of my paws.'
</p>

<p>
"'You are very big,' admitted
the crow.  'You are the biggest
bear I ever saw&mdash;and you seem
to be colored wrong, too.  But
that is neither here nor there.  We
do not think much of size in this
country.'
</p>

<p>
"'Oh, don't you?' snarled King
Bear.  'Well, perhaps you'll
change your views before very
long.  And what do you mean by
saying I am colored wrong?'
</p>

<p>
"'Black and brown are the correct
colors for bears,' said the crow.
'Dirty white looks both foolish
and untidy.'
</p>

<p>
"Just then the six wolves and
the two black bears reached the
bottom of the hill.  There they
halted, and one of the wolves cried
out, 'What are you doing here, big
stranger?'
</p>

<p>
"'I am sitting on the top of a
hill, admiring your beautiful
country,' replied the white bear, in a
snarly voice.
</p>

<p>
"'What do you want?' asked the wolf.
</p>

<p>
"'Something to eat,' said the white bear.
</p>

<p>
"'Where did you come from?' asked the wolf.
</p>

<p>
"'You miserable creature, I
came from my own country where
I am king,' roared the bear.  'And
I want you to know that I did not
come here to answer your
questions!  Bring me something to
eat&mdash;a fat caribou, or a couple of
seals&mdash;or I'll try my teeth on
you!'
</p>

<p>
"'Your talk is as big as your
body; but neither big words nor
big bodies are much thought of in
this country,' replied the wolf.
</p>

<p>
"King Bear was astonished at
the wolf's daring in speaking to
him so impudently.  He had never
been spoken to in that way before
by any common animal or bird.
Of course King Moose, his rival,
had said rude things to him every
year; but that was to be expected
and was between kings.  But it
made his blood bubble in his brain
to hear such words from that
ordinary wolf, and to see the other
common creatures, and the crow
grinning at the talk.  He was so
angry that he almost forgot the
hungry-pain in his stomach.
</p>

<p>
"'I am a great king,' he roared,
and got to his feet, ready to destroy
the six wolves and the two black
bears with one sweep of his mighty
right paw.  But he did not do it!
He saw something running on
the snow, so fast that he could not
make out what it was&mdash;and suddenly
it stopped close under his
great nose and he saw that it was
a slim young man.  He was so
astonished that he squatted back
on his haunches.
</p>

<p>
"'I have been listening to you,'
said the young man, 'and I do not
like your talk.  Also, I do not
like your looks.  You are too big
and too bold to be a safe companion
for my people.'
</p>

<p>
"King Bear could do nothing but stare.
</p>

<p>
"'I am Gluskap,' continued the
young man, 'and all the men
and animals in this land, for
seven times as far as you can
see in every direction, are in my care.'
</p>

<p>
"'I never heard of you,' said
the big white bear.
</p>

<p>
"The young man smiled at that.
Then he pointed his finger at the
stranger and gazed at him very
hard with his bright eyes.
</p>

<p>
"'I feel queer.  My head spins
'round and 'round,' said the bear.
He began to sway from side to
side.  He stood on his four strong
legs; but still he swayed and
swayed, and his mouth hung open
and he breathed very hard.
</p>

<p>
"'What&mdash;are&mdash;you&mdash;doing&mdash;to&mdash;me?' he gasped.
</p>

<p>
"'I am reducing you,' replied
the young man.
</p>

<p>
"King Bear did not know what
that meant&mdash;and he felt so queer
that he did not care.  All the
white world seemed to go whirling
around him.  At last he fell
over, flat on his side.  And as
soon as that had happened he felt
quite well again and jumped to
his feet.  Well, he blinked his red
eyes and he glared and glared, for
it looked to him as if the man, the
crow, the wolves, and the black
bears had all grown much larger.
But that was not what had
happened at all.  The change was
in himself and not in the others.
Gluskap, with his magic, had
made him smaller and smaller until
he was just exactly the size of white
bears now and smaller than common
black bears were in those days.
</p>

<p>
"'Now that you are a small
bear and not at all dangerous to
the peace of this country, you may
come with me and have something
to eat,' said Gluskap.  'And if
you behave yourself I think my
people will be kind to you and let
you live in this country.  Come,
it is dinner time.'
</p>

<p>
"He turned toward the south
and walked slowly away.  Then
the white bear followed him,
wondering to find himself so mild and
obedient.  The other animals
followed, too, and the crow flew on
ahead.  One of the wolves walked
beside the white bear.
</p>

<p>
"'The crow told me that this
country was without a king,' said
the bear.  'But that man is your
king, surely!'
</p>

<p>
"'Oh, now, he is one of the
gods,' said the wolf.  'He feeds
us, and keeps our enemies from
harming us.  Is that what kings
do for their people?'
</p>

<p>
"'I never heard of a king doing
things like that,' replied the white
bear.  'But what does he feed you
with?' he asked, for again he felt
the hungry-pain in his stomach&mdash;and
though he was so much smaller
now, the pain felt just as big as
when he was his old size.
</p>

<p>
"'Just whatever you want,' said
the wolf.  'His lodge is behind
the next hill, so you will soon know
as much about it as I know.  All
the men and animals and birds are
there by now, I think, waiting for
their food.  Don't you hear them
talking?'  Oh, yes the white bear
heard them talking.  It sounded
just like the running of sea waves
up and back along a pebbly shore.
And now the scents of that hidden
multitude reached his keen nose.
He smelt every kind of living
creature he had ever smelled before
in all his life, except fish and
seals.  He knew that men were
there, beyond the hill, and moose,
caribou, bears, wolves, foxes, otters,
wild-cats, mink, porcupine, red deer,
woodchucks, hares, mice, beaver,
muskrats, badgers, and all kinds
of birds.
</p>

<p>
"'Hah, that smells good,' he
said, and sniffed very hard.  'That
certainly smells like a fine dinner.
I'll be puzzled to know what to
eat first.  A fat beaver would not
be bad to start with, as there does
not seem to be any kind of fresh fish.'
</p>

<p>
"'You are all wrong.  You will
not be allowed to eat any of those
animals.  They are waiting for
their dinners just as hungrily as
you are; and what would they
think, do you suppose, if Gluskap
allowed you to kill them and eat them?'
</p>

<p>
"'Then what on earth are we
going to eat?' asked the white bear.
</p>

<p>
"'You'll soon find that out for
yourself,' replied the wolf.
</p>

<p>
"Gluskap led the way straight up
the side of the steep hill.  There,
on the other side, stood a great
lodge of poles and bark,
surrounded by several hundred men,
thousands of animals, and great
flocks of birds settling down and
flying up and lighting again.  The
white bear gazed at the scene in
astonishment.  There stood wolves
and caribou side by side, and hares
and wild-cats lay together on the snow.
</p>

<p>
"'Why don't they fight?' he
asked.  'Why don't the bears and
wolves eat the silly little men and
the fat hares and beavers?'
</p>

<p>
"'No need of it,' said the wolf.
'It is easier to eat Gluskap's food.'
</p>

<p>
"Now they halted at the edge
of the crowd.  They saw Gluskap
walk into his great lodge.  Soon
he came out with a basket in one
hand.  He walked among the men
and animals, scattering on every
side something that looked like
sand.  The moment those little
grains touched the ground, each one
became a piece of food.  A grain
that dropped in front of a beaver
became a juicy fragment of pond-lily
root.  The grains that fell before
the caribou turned into bundles
of caribou-moss.  The grains that
fell near the bears and wolves and
men became meat and fish of many
kinds.  Well, it was the most
wonderful thing that the white bear
had ever dreamed of; and when he
suddenly found a big, fresh salmon
and a lump of beaver flesh under
his very nose, he was too happy to
do anything but eat and eat."
</p>

<p>
Old Squat-by-the-fire ceased her
story-telling, leaned back against a
heap of robes and blankets, and
closed her eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Did Gluskap make all the
food out of sand?" asked Flying Plover.
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  Now you must go to
bed, little son of a chief."
</p>

<p>
"Did King Bear stay with Gluskap?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  Go to bed now, Flying Plover."
</p>

<p>
"Didn't he ever go back to his own country?"
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps he did.  I don't know.
Go to bed."
</p>

<p>
"What happened to old King Walrus?"
</p>

<p>
"I won't tell you to-night.  Go to bed!"
</p>

<p>
"Did King Moose come home and fight him?"
</p>

<p>
"Go to bed!  Go to bed!  Go&mdash;to&mdash;bed!"
</p>

<p>
So, at last, while the fire still
burned brightly, little Flying
Plover went to bed under a soft
robe of furs&mdash;and with most of
his clothes on too.  But his
grandmother sat up for an hour or
two longer, and smoked another
pipeful of tobacco.

<h3>
IV
<br><br>
HOW FIRE CAME TO THE MOUNTAINEERS
</h3>

<p>
Flying Plover was awake bright
and early next morning, and went
right out in the cold and snow to
get wood for his grandmother's
fire.  The men of the village
always kept the old medicine-woman's
wood pile well supplied&mdash;so
the little boy had no chopping
to do, but just carried armfuls of
dry sticks into the lodge.  Though
it was nearly breakfast time, the
sun was not yet up; but a narrow
yellow band edged the horizon in
one place, and in the faint twilight
several people besides Flying
Plover were moving about out of
doors.  Some were getting wood,
and some were carrying water from
the hole in the frozen brook.  Big
Hunter, the chief of the village,
was feeding frozen fish to his
sledge-dogs; for he and his sons
were going to make an early start
in search of caribou.  The air was
very still and cold, and the tall trees
which stood all around and among
the lodges snapped in the frost.
Little Flying Plover was too cold
to even shout out to his friends.
This was the part of the day which
he did not like&mdash;the short time
before the fire was lighted and
breakfast was cooked.  So he
worked very fast, running
backward and forward between the
lodge and the wood pile.  His task
was soon done; and soon the fire
burned cheerily in the middle of
the lodge, the smoke streamed up
to the peak of the roof and out
into the frosty air, and the old
medicine-woman put the tea-kettle
and the frying-pan on the coals.
</p>

<p>
After breakfast, Squat-by-the-fire
gave her little grandson a lesson
in moccasin-sewing; and after the
lesson she kept him at work at
making a pair of moccasins while she
steeped medicines.  For a little
while in the afternoon he worked
at carving a caribou from a block
of wood; but it was hard work, and
he cut his finger; and after a
whole hour of scooping and cutting,
the thing still looked more like
a block than a caribou.  He
almost cried.  In fact, two tears
rolled out of his eyes and half-way
down his fat cheeks before he
remembered that warriors do not
weep and hastily wiped them away
with the back of his hand.  His
grandmother did not let him know
that she had seen the tears; but
she tied a piece of rag around
his cut finger and told him to
go out and play with the other
little boys.
</p>

<p>
That night, old Squat-by-the-fire
told Flying Plover some more
about King Walrus, and about a
man called Porcupine Killer.
</p>

<p>
"When King Moose returned
to this country," she said, "with his
fine horns all ready for knocking
King Bear about, and found old
King Walrus here instead, he was
not at all pleased with the change.
One look at the big walrus told
him that he had met his master,
horns or no horns.  But he was
full of courage and felt that right
was on his side&mdash;so with a snort
of rage he tried to roll King
Walrus from the hill on which he lay,
sleeping soundly.  But he might
as well have tried to roll the hill
from under King Walrus.  There
was a short and terrible
fight&mdash;and then poor King Moose
limped away and lay down in a
distant forest to think the matter
over.  He hid in the forest for
many days and asked every animal
and bird that came within
speaking distance where King
Bear had gone to.  But not one
of them could tell him that.  All
they knew was that he had been
chased out of the country by the
old blubber-mountain from the
north.  The moose was very sorry
that no one could tell him where
his rival had gone to.  He thought
that he and King Bear together
could drive King Walrus back to
his own country.  But as there
seemed to be no chance of finding
the bear, he continued to live
quietly in the distant forest.  For
exercise, he knocked the great pine
trees over with his horns.  None
of the other animals were big
enough for him to fight with&mdash;and
King Walrus was too big.
</p>

<p>
<a id="p45"></a>
"The walrus did not stay in
this country very long; but while
he was here, men suffered even
more than they had suffered
before.  The reason for this was
that a great many fierce animals
from the north had followed their
king into this country.  The whole
land was full of bears and wolves
and giant foxes; and
people&mdash;mountaineer people&mdash;died of
hunger in their caves because the
men were afraid to go out and
hunt.  It was not safe for a
warrior to so much as show his nose
outside of his hiding-place.  If
things had gone on in that way
for another moon, I think the
whole tribe of mankind in this
country would have starved or
been killed&mdash;and if that had
happened you and I would not be
sitting here to-night."
</p>

<p>
"Where would we be sitting?"
asked Flying Plover.
</p>

<p>
"We would not be sitting
anywhere.  We would never have
been born," replied the old woman.
</p>

<p>
"Why not?" asked the little boy.
</p>

<p>
But Squat-by-the-fire knew that
if she answered any more of his
questions he would keep her busy
all night.  So she hastened on
with her story.
</p>

<p>
"There was a young man
named Porcupine Killer," she
continued.  "He had once killed a
porcupine with only a flint knife
for a weapon&mdash;and porcupines
in those days were larger than
bears are now.  That is how he
got his name.  But the porcupine
had been eaten years ago, and now
he was not able to go out and kill
even a mouse.  You need not
laugh at that, for mice were then
as big as beavers are now&mdash;and
just as good eating, too.  He knew
that if he went ten yards from the
narrow mouth of his cave some
great animal would leap upon
him.  He had a wife and little
baby; and all the three had eaten
for two days was part of a fish
that a hawk had accidentally
dropped in front of the cave as
it flew over, chased by an eagle.
He could not think of anything
to do.  When night fell he would
creep out and feel about for some
bones.  With so many great
animals killing and feeding on all
sides there would surely be plenty
of fresh bones lying around.  He
had seen a pack of great wolves
chasing a giant caribou along the
valley below his cave early that
morning.  If he could find the
bones of that caribou he would
be lucky.  The marrow in one
of those bones would supply
them with many meals.  But as
he had to wait until night to
begin his hunt and had nothing
to do in the meantime, he lay
down on a bed of dry leaves and
fell asleep.
</p>

<p>
"A wonderful dream came to
Porcupine Killer while he lay
asleep in his dark cave, with his
belt drawn tight around his
stomach because of the hungry-pain.
Some good spirit must have
come and whispered that dream
into his brain, for in it there was
hardly one thing like anything he
had ever seen; and yet it was all
just as if he looked down at
something that was really happening.
He saw a place of flat, white sand
(at first he thought it was snow, for
there is no sand so white in this
country) with the sea at one edge
of it, green as leaves in Spring and
blue as the sky, and strange-looking
trees and bushes along the other
side.  On the sand, mid-way
between the trees and the edge of the
beautiful sea, stood a man.
Porcupine Killer had never before seen
such a queer-looking man.  His
skin, all over his face and body, was
as dark as the roof of this lodge
where the smoke has painted it.
He was naked as a trout.  At his
feet lay a bunch of dry grass and a
heap of little sticks.  In his hands
he held something that looked like
a very short bow with a doubled,
twisted cord made of some kind of
vine, and a piece of dry, flat wood.
He sat down on the sand, crossed
his legs, crumbled a little of the
dry grass between his hands and
placed the powder close beside
him, on the sand.  Then, holding
the flat piece of wood firm between
his knees with his left hand, he
placed the cord of the bow in a
notch across it and began to draw
it swiftly back and forth, back and
forth, quick as lightning.  The
spirit of Porcupine Killer (for it
did not seem to him that his body
was in the dream at all) bent close
above the queer-looking black man,
eager to find out what he was
trying to do.  The stranger worked
and worked, his hand flying back
and forth so fast that it could
scarcely be seen.  The sweat stood
out on his black skin.  Soon a
faint, blue mist crept up from the
notch in the slab of dry wood&mdash;or
was it from the flying cord of
twisted vine?  It floated up and
melted in the sunlight; then it
floated up again; and again it
melted to nothing.  Porcupine
Killer could make no sense out
of it; but he liked the look of the
dry, blue mist.  The worker now
clutched the wood tight between
his knees, keeping his right hand
still speeding with the bow, and
with the fingers of his left hand
took up a pinch of the grass-powder
and sprinkled it where the
cord of vine flew along the notch.
Now the blue mist arose in a little
cloud, and climbed high above the
worker's head before it melted.
It had a smell&mdash;a smell that
seemed very good to the spirit of
Porcupine Killer.  His nose had
never met with anything like it
before, and yet it awoke a strange
craving within him, and seemed to
speak of comfort and safety.
</p>

<p>
"Still the strange man went on
with his strange work, driving the
bow back and forth with his right
hand and sprinkling a little of the
powder of dry grass with his left.
Suddenly the mist puffed white
and thick, and in a moment faded
to something so faint that it had
no color at all, and yet seemed to
waver upward and melt away,
even as the mist had floated and
melted&mdash;and, in the same instant,
a living thing, yellow and bright
and no bigger than a baby's finger,
moved on the flat piece of wood.
</p>

<p>
"It was like a bright, strange
bird.  It was like a beautiful
flower that bursts suddenly into
bloom and life from a husk of
bray seed.  It was like magic!&mdash;like
the eye of a god!&mdash;like the
secret of life!  At least so it
seemed to Porcupine Killer.
Nothing before, except the feelings
of love and courage, had ever
awakened so much joy in him.
</p>

<p>
"'What is it?  Give it to me,'
he cried; but his spirit had no
voice, and the man on the sand
did not so much as turn his head.
He was still busy with the magic
thing that had so suddenly come
to his hand.  Now he ceased the
movement of the bow and let it
fall on the sand, where it lay
unheeded, with a faint mist arising
from the cord of twisted vine.
He fed the yellow, living thing
with leaves of the dry grass, and
it grew and leapt under his hand.
Suddenly he turned to the little
bunch of dry grass at his elbow&mdash;and,
quick as thought, every fiber
of it had blossomed to red and
yellow.  Now, from the heap of
twigs and sticks, he fed that
wonderful, leaping thing that had
flashed into life but a few
moments before, no larger than a
baby's finger, and that now
covered a space on the sand as wide
and long as a snow-shoe track."
</p>

<p>
"What was it?" asked little
Flying Plover, in an awed whisper.
</p>

<p>
"It was fire&mdash;fire like that,"
replied the old medicine-woman,
pointing at the glowing coals and
leaping flames within the circle of
stones in the center of the floor.
For a moment the child looked
puzzled, and glanced at his grandmother
to see if she were laughing
at him.  Then he nodded his head.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, the fire is alive," he said;
"but why did the queer, black
man rub the bow across the flat
piece of wood?"
</p>

<p>
"There were no matches in
those days such as the traders
sell now," replied the old woman.
"And fire could not be struck
out of the flint as it was when I
was young, because there was no
steel with which to strike the flint.
All these things that I am telling
you happened a very long time ago,
little son of a chief."
</p>

<p>
Again Flying Plover nodded his head.
</p>

<p>
"And then what did the queer
man on the sand do when his fire
was burning so well?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"I do not know what he did,"
replied Squat-by-the-fire, "for just
when the sticks were crackling and
the flames leaping high as the
flames of our own fire, the spirit
of Porcupine Killer flew back to
his body and poor Porcupine
Killer opened his eyes and found
himself lying on the bed of leaves
in his dark, narrow cave.  And
the hungry-pain gnawed him again,
and he heard his wife crying
beside him as she rocked the little
baby in her arms.  But there was
a lightness in his heart that had
not been there when he fell asleep,
and his dream was as clear as a
picture in his mind.  He got up
quickly from his bed of leaves and
dry moss, and crawled to the back
of the cave where some of his
bows and spears were stored,
along with several pieces of
seasoned wood for the making of
arrows.  Without telling the
woman a word of his wonderful
dream, he broke one of his bows
in two pieces.  But the string of
caribou sinew was not what he
wanted.  He felt about in the
dark, and soon found some strands
of tough hemlock root which he
had once used for snares.  Finding
three strands of a length, he
plated them together into one
thick, tough cord&mdash;and with this
he strung a piece of the broken bow.
</p>

<p>
"'What are you doing?' asked
his wife.
</p>

<p>
"'Perhaps you shall soon see.
Have patience,' he replied.  The
poor woman thought that hunger
and despair had weakened his
mind.  But she stopped her weeping
and drew near to him, the better
to see what he was about.  Having
fixed a short bow to suit him,
he broke across his knee many of
the sticks and slabs of seasoned
wood, from which he had intended
to make such fine arrows.  Across
the flat side of one of these pieces
he scraped a shallow groove with his
stone knife.  When that was done,
he collected ten handfuls of dry
moss and grass from his bed.
Some of this he powdered between
his hands, as he had seen the
strange, naked man do in his dream.
Then, when all was ready, he sat
on the cold floor of the cave and
began to draw the cord of the bow
swiftly back and forth across the
flat piece of wood, just as the black
man had done.  He worked and
worked&mdash;and at last his nose
caught the smell of the blue mist,
though he could not see the mist
because of the darkness of the cave.
But he saw beautiful, bright sparks
darting along the groove in the
wood.  By that time, his right arm
ached as if it had been twisted
and beaten with a club; but he
kept the bow flying, and began to
sprinkle the powdered grass with
his left hand.  Then (as he had
seen in his dream) the small
creature of magic life&mdash;the bright,
yellow thing that ate the powdered
grass and sprang upward for
more&mdash;flashed into being on the slab
of wood between his knees.  The
squaw uttered a low cry of wonder;
but Porcupine Killer said not a
word.  He fed dry moss and grass
to the wonderful thing&mdash;and it
grew, and flashed with a redder
color.  Then, doing what he had
seen the naked, black man do, he
slipped it from the wood to the
heap of dry stuff at his side.  The
bright tongues leapt upward, throwing
a beautiful light into every
corner of the cave.  The mist,
which seemed to be its breath,
streamed along the top of the cave
and floated out through a hole in
the rocky roof.  The man heaped
fragments of seasoned wood upon
it, one by one.  Then he felt the
heat on his face and hands, and
all through the chilly cave, like summer.
</p>

<p>
"'Come close,' he said to the
woman.  'It is warm as the sun
when the willows have their leaves
and the yellow butterflies swarm
on the sand by the river.'
</p>

<p>
"'What is it?  What is this
strange thing that you have made
with your hands?' whispered the woman.
</p>

<p>
"'Nay, I did not make it.  It
is the gift of some kind god,
bestowed on me while I dreamed,'
replied Porcupine Killer.  'Come
close, and feel the comfort of it
Do not fear it, for I am sure it is
good.  If it is not good, then why
does the sight of it awaken joy in
my heart?'
</p>

<p>
"The woman drew near, with
her baby in her arms; and now,
for the first time in her life, she
felt the warmth of fire.
</p>

<p>
"'It is like the sun in the
spring time,' she said.  'It melts
the chill of the frost out of my
bones, and gladdens my eyes.'
</p>

<p>
"But Porcupine Killer did not
answer, for he was busy feeding
the new fire with all the wood he
could find in the cave; and, of
course, the fire grew and grew,
and sent showers of sparks flying
along the roof.
</p>

<p>
"'It grows too fast,' cried the
woman.  'You feed it with too
much dry wood.  It may eat up
the stone walls of the cave, if it
grows any larger.'
</p>

<p>
"Just then, a spark dropped on
the bed of grass and moss and
leaves and, in a moment, a little
flame began leaping here and
there.  But Porcupine Killer, who
had a bright mind, saw the danger.
He snatched up the burning stuff
in his hands and threw it upon the
big fire.  The little flame touched
his fingers.  He cried out, with
pain and surprise.
</p>

<p>
"'What is the matter?' asked the woman.
</p>

<p>
"'The magic thing stung me,'
replied Porcupine Killer."
</p>

<p>
The old medicine woman ceased
her talk and lit the tobacco in her
pipe with a brand from the fire.
Flying Plover waited politely until
he saw, by the clouds of tobacco
smoke, that the pipe was well
alight.  Then, as his grandmother
seemed to have forgotten to go on
with the story, he said, "I wonder
if that was truly the way fire first
came to our tribe?"
</p>

<p>
Squat-by-the-fire glanced at him
quickly, but never said a word.
She knew that the little boy was
trying to get her to go on with the
story&mdash;and that was what she had
not the slightest intention of doing.
If she went on telling him stories
as long as he would listen, neither
of them would ever get any sleep,
and her brain would become quite
dry and brittle from too much
inventing.
</p>

<p>
"I think Porcupine Killer must
have been sorry that he did not
have anything to cook at his fine,
new fire," remarked the little boy.
</p>

<p>
The old woman was just going
to tell him that people did not
know anything about cooking in
those days&mdash;but she didn't.  Flying
Plover was clever; but so was
she.  Instead of saying the words
that so nearly slipped from her
tongue, she gave a raspy little
cough.  Then, in a faint whisper,
she said, "My throat is so sore
from talking so much, that I fear
all the skin is worn off the inside
of it."
</p>

<p>
That seemed a very strange and
interesting thing to Flying Plover.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, let me see it," he cried.
"How long will it take to grow
on again?"
</p>

<p>
His grandmother almost lost
her temper at that.  Anyway, she
soon had him snug in bed; and
it was not long before he was
sound asleep.

<h3>
V
<br><br>
HOW PORCUPINE KILLER LEARNED STILL<br>
MORE ABOUT THE WONDERFUL FIRE
</h3>

<p>
During the night snow began to
fall.  In the morning the sky was
still gray with it; and all day it
continued to weave its gray curtains
in the windless air.  So little
Flying Plover stayed indoors most
of the day, cutting and gouging
at the block of wood which he
hopefully believed would soon
resemble a caribou, and watching
old Squat-by-the-fire at her
medicine-work.  The old woman did
not talk much while she was mixing
and attending to the pots, of
steeping herbs; but by mid-afternoon
she was ready to go on with
the telling of her story.  Her voice
sounded quite natural again, and
the little boy wondered that the
skin had grown on it so quickly.
But he said nothing about his
wonderment, for he did not want
to divert her from the story.
</p>

<p>
"When Porcupine Killer felt
the burn of the fire on his hand
he was frightened at first," said
the old woman, "but he soon
recovered from his fright, and
began to study the blazing sticks
and red coals very attentively.
He held out his hand, feeling the
pleasant warmth.  He advanced
it closer and closer to the flames,
noticing that the warmth increased
and still increased the nearer he
went, until at last it hurt.  Then
he touched a red coal with his
finger&mdash;and that made him hop.
He sucked his finger, and thought
very hard.  'It stings when you
touch it,' he said, 'but if you do
not touch it, it gives you warmth,
like the sun in summer.  If I take
a stick in my hand, at the end
where this wonder-creature is not
eating, and thrust it against my
enemy, then, without hurting me,
it will sting my enemy.'
</p>

<p>
"'Yes,' said the squaw.  'But
look, it has eaten nearly all the
wood, and is falling smaller and
smaller, like a snowdrift in May,'
she added.
</p>

<p>
"Porcupine Killer thought of
a dry, dead spruce tree that lay
near the mouth of his cave, flat
along the ground where a great
wind had thrown it a year before.
But he was afraid to go out,
unprotected, to break branches from
this tree and drag them back to
the cave.  It was not yet night,
and the giant beasts would be
waiting for him.  He saw one
long stick in the fire that was
burning for only half its length
and, heeding a voice within him
that told him to trust in the new
gift of the gods, he took up the
stick by the unscorched end,
crawled through the mouth of the
cave, and ran to the fallen tree.
As he ran&mdash;'twas only the
distance of a dozen strides&mdash;he
waved the long stick around his
head.  It was twined 'round with
red and yellow flames, and smoke
and sparks flew upward from it.
He saw two great wolves spring
out of the forest on his left, glare
at him with glowing eyes and
gaping jaws, turn and flee back
into the forest.  He saw a fox
(as big as a wolf of to-day) slink
out of his path.  Then he knew
that this new and wonderful thing
was as surely a terror to the beasts
as it was a joy to him.  They did
not even wait for its sting.  They
fled, like hunted hares, at the sight
of it!  And he knew that this
terror of it must have been born
in the wolves and foxes even as
the joy in it, and love of it, had
been born in him.  He leaned the
burning stick against the trunk of
the fallen tree and quickly tore off
an armful of the dry branches.
Leaving the flaming stick behind
him, he ran back to the cave
and quickly replenished the fire.
Again he returned to the tree and
loaded his arms.  Three times he
made the short journey, swiftly, but
without much fear of the beasts.
He knew that many fierce animals
were watching him; but his faith
in their terror of the burning stick
was great.  When he crawled from
the cave to get the fourth load of
wood, a wonderful sight met his
eyes.  The flames from the stick
had leapt into the dry branches of
the tree and cloaked them in red
and yellow.  Swiftly it leapt from
branch to branch until, in a twinkling,
the tree was blazing along its
whole length, from roots to crown.
It made a loud crackling noise and
a roaring like the voices of wind
and water.  Smoke and sparks
flew upward in clouds.

<br>
&quot;He waved the long stick around his head&quot;
</p>

<p>
"For a few minutes Porcupine
Killer stood just outside the
mouth of his cave and gazed at
the wonderful sight with awe.
The first thin darkness was
creeping over the world, and in the
gloom the flames and sparks and
smoke made a terrible picture for
eyes that had never seen such a
thing before.  But the little chill
of fear quickly left his heart as
soon as he began to reason with
his brain.  This creature&mdash;one
moment so small, and suddenly so
great&mdash;was his friend and the
friend of all mankind.  It was a
wonderful gift that had been given
to him in a beautiful dream.  So
he ran forward and stood as close
to the fire as he could.  The heat
of it was very great&mdash;and the
roaring of the flames and the
crackling of the dry wood was
loud in his ears.  He knew that
many eyes must now be staring
at the great sight in fear and
astonishment and wonder&mdash;eyes
of his fierce enemies and eyes of
his hunted, starving people.  Many
caves were in the same rocky hillside
as his own.  With his back
to the noise and the leaping flames,
he stood tall and brave against the
terrible red light and waved his
arms high above his head.
</p>

<p>
"'Come to me, my people!' he
cried, with all the strength of his
voice.  'Come to me, and this
magic thing will protect you from
your enemies.'
</p>

<p>
"Broken Arrow was the first to
find courage to leave his cave and
draw near to the fire.  He was
closely followed by Winter Morning,
the chief.  Porcupine Killer
told them in a few words of his
dream and how he had made the
fire in his cave; of its comforting
warmth; of its sting; and how the
animals feared the sight of it.
Soon a dozen men and boys stood
near the blazing tree.
</p>

<p>
"'Now is the time to hunt for
food,' said Porcupine Killer.  'Do
not go beyond the edge of the red
light.'
</p>

<p>
"They found the body of a
huge caribou, freshly killed by
the wolves and but half eaten.
They cut the flesh from it with
their stone knives and axes, and
carried it to their caves.
Porcupine Killer worked with the
others and carried two great lumps
of meat to his cave; but he kept
his eye on the burning tree.  He
soon noticed that it was quickly
lessening in size and heat.  All
the branches were gone and the
great trunk alone glowed on the
rocky ground.  Flames and sparks
still shot up from it in places, and
here and there it had crumbled to
masses of red coals.  Dark night
had fallen by now, and the light
from the fire was drawing in,
narrower and narrower, every minute.
By the failing glow of it,
Porcupine-Killer gathered a great many
pieces of wood-roots and fallen
branches and stumps, and heaped
them close beside the mouth of his
cave.  He told Broken Arrow
(who was a clever young warrior)
and old Winter Morning, the chief,
how fire could be kept inside one's
cave and fed with sticks; and he
lighted two long branches at the
glowing coals and gave one into the
hands of each.  Many of the other
men, seeing this and hearing Porcupine
Killer's words, lit sticks for
themselves and ran back to their
caves, waving them in the air.
</p>

<p>
"It was quite dark, and the great
beasts were roaring and howling
and barking on all sides, when the
first man who had ever made fire
in this part of the world returned
to his cave.
</p>

<p>
"He found the fire burning very
low,&mdash;just a bed of coals,&mdash;for the
woman was afraid to feed it with
sticks.  He soon had it blazing
brightly; and then, sitting very
close to it, he began to cut one of
the big lumps of caribou meat into
small pieces, so that he and his
wife might eat after their long
hunger.  One of the pieces fell
close to the red coals at the edge
of the fire.  He did not notice it,
but soon he began to sniff and look
about on every side.
</p>

<p>
"'What is that queer smell?' he
asked.  'It is a smell that
increases my hunger.  What new
thing have you in the cave?'
</p>

<p>
"The squaw told him that there
was nothing new in the cave except
the fire and the caribou meat.  But
she, too, noticed the smell and
began to sniff and sniff.  Her
husband (who had not the baby to
hold) was so attracted by the
strange smell that he laid aside the
flint knife and the big lump of meat
and went sniffing around the cave,
as a hungry dog sniffs around the
outside of a store-house.  But he
was soon back at the fire again,
where the smell was much stronger
than anywhere else; and then he
happened to see the small piece of
meat that had fallen close to the
red coals.  Its color had changed.
It was red no longer, but brown as
a ripe nut; and from it floated up
the smell that made him feel even
more hungry than he had felt
before.  He touched it with his
finger.  It was very hot, so of
course he stuck his finger in his
mouth.  Hah, but it tasted good!
He had never really liked the taste
of flesh before, but had always
eaten it quickly, in big mouthfuls,
simply to fill his stomach; but this
piece, that had been turned from
red to brown by the fire, had a taste
to it that made him think of eating
with joy.  With a small stick he
drew it away from the hot coals,
and soon the sting of the fire went
out of it and he could hold it in
his hands without feeling any pain.
He cut it in two with his flint knife
and gave one half to his wife.  And
they were the first people to eat
roasted caribou meat that I ever
heard of!  They liked it so well
that they cut many more slices and
placed them close to the red coals
of the fire; and the good,
hunger-making smell floated out of the
cave and set all sorts of animals to
sniffing and howling.  They liked
the strange smell, too (though they
never learned to like it as well as
the smell of raw meat); but they
were afraid to go near the cave in the
rocky hill-side from which the smell
came, for out of that same cave
shone the red glare of that terrible
thing which had eaten up the dead
spruce tree.  They saw the same
red glare at the mouths of other
caves and what was left of the
spruce tree still glowing angrily in
the dark; so they crouched in
a great circle and howled and
roared."
</p>

<p>
Old Squat-by-the-fire stopped
her talk suddenly, and began cutting
tobacco for her pipe.  Little
Flying Plover sat very still, gazing
into the fire.  He could see all
sorts of queer things under the
dancing flames, deep among the
red coals&mdash;lodges, and hunters
running beside dog-sledges, and
warriors fighting mighty battles.
</p>

<p>
"Why were the animals afraid
of the fire?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"It was their nature to fear it,"
replied his grandmother.
</p>

<p>
"Why didn't it frighten the
men, too?" asked the boy.
</p>

<p>
Squat-by-the-fire wrinkled her
forehead and puffed hard at her
pipe, but did not answer.  Flying
Plover waited for a minute, and
then asked, "Are animals afraid
of fire now?"
</p>

<p>
His grandmother nodded her head.
</p>

<p>
"But dogs are not afraid of
it.  Dogs like to lie by the fire,
all day and all night," said the boy.
</p>

<p>
"Dogs were not always fond of
fire.  When they were wild&mdash;before
they had been tamed by man&mdash;they
did not like it at all," replied
the old woman.
</p>

<p>
She puffed very fiercely at her
pipe.  "But you must not ask me
any more questions now," she said.
"I must boil the medicine for Red
Cloud's baby again.  It is a very
great medicine and has to be boiled
five times, in all, and let cool after
each boiling.  So you must not
disturb me, little son of a chief.
Carve at your caribou again, if the
snow is still falling, and I will tell
you another story to-night, if you
are a good boy."

<h3>
VI
<br><br>
WHY OLD KING WALRUS WENT AWAY<br>
FROM THE MOUNTAINEERS' COUNTRY
</h3>

<p>
Flying Plover was a good boy.
He carved at the stubborn block
of wood until it looked quite
unlike a block of wood and had four
legs, like a caribou.  Then he
whittled away at two arrows, and
mended one of his snowshoes.
He did not once disturb his
grandmother at her medicine-making; so
after the evening meal the old
woman said that, as he had behaved
himself so well and worked so
busily, she would tell him another
story.
</p>

<p>
"I want to know why all the
animals are smaller now than they
used to be," said the boy.  "I
want to know how that happened
and when&mdash;and who did it."
</p>

<p>
"Easy, easy!" cried Squat-by-the-fire.
"You go too fast with your
'want to know this' and your 'want
to know that.'  Stories are not
told by the answering of questions.
You will hear about the changing
of the animals later&mdash;but to-night
I am going to tell you why old
King Walrus went back to his
own country."
</p>

<p>
She scratched her head, and
stared very hard at the fire, as if
she found a good deal of difficulty
in remembering the facts.  And
that is not to be wondered at,
considering how long ago it was that
King Walrus went away from
Labrador, and how many queer
things had happened since then.
Little Flying Plover often
wondered at the way his grandmother
remembered those very ancient
happenings, and yet sometimes forgot
little things that he could
remember perfectly clearly.  Well, she
scratched her head, and stared at
the fire&mdash;and, presently, she
remembered.
</p>

<p>
"When King Walrus heard
about the strange thing in front of
the two-legged people's hillside,"
she said, "he floundered to the top
of a near-by hummock and looked
at it in wonder and with a queer
feeling inside him.  The queer
feeling was fear&mdash;and King Walrus
had never felt it before.  He
looked at the leaping flames and
wondered if the sky had broken
and the red sunset had fallen on
the world.  He looked at the
smoke which poured up in black
clouds and white clouds and blue
clouds; and he thought that they,
too, had fallen from the sky and
were now hurrying back to it.  And
the sparks?  Why, the stupid old
fellow thought those were stars.
His people&mdash;the smaller walruses
and bears and arctic foxes that had
followed him from the ice-fields&mdash;told
him that the terrible creature
was eating a tree just as they would
eat a fresh cod-fish.  They told
him to listen, and they would hear
it growling and cracking the dry
wood with its red teeth.  The old
Walrus listened, and sure enough,
he heard those terrible sounds.  So
it was certainly not the sky.  'I
hope it will not stay in this
country,' he said.  'Where did it
come from?'
</p>

<p>
"A fox said 'One of the
man-creatures carried it out to the
dead tree from his den.  It was
very small at first&mdash;no bigger
than my tongue&mdash;and danced on
the end of a long stick.  But it
was frightful to look at, even then.'
</p>

<p>
"'Why did you not jump upon
it, and kill it, when it was so
small?' asked old King Walrus.
But he did not speak in his usual
loud voice.
</p>

<p>
"'I had not the courage,' said
the fox.  'And I saw some
animals, who are much larger and
stronger than I am, turn around
and run away, too,' he added.
</p>

<p>
"Old blubber-sides could not
think of anything just then but
the roaring fire in the valley below.
Though he had believed, at first,
that it was a piece of the red,
sunset sky, now that he could hear it
growling and biting the wood with
its teeth, he felt sure that it was
some terrible, new animal that
would want to fight him as soon as
it had finished eating the tree.  But
what had it been doing in the den
of one of the little, miserable,
two-legged men-folk?  He lay there
on the hummock and stared and
stared, expecting, every moment,
to see it move toward him.
</p>

<p>
"Then the fox who had spoken
before said, 'The same man who
put it in the branches of the tree
has another creature of the same
kind in his den.  I smelt it&mdash;and
I saw its breath rising through a
crack in the rocks.'
</p>

<p>
"For a moment King Walrus
turned his great head from the
direction of the blazing tree and
looked at the fox.  'Go down and
examine it closely, and see if it has
any legs,' he said.  For a few
seconds the fox did not know what to
do or say, and felt very foolish.
He was afraid of King Walrus&mdash;but
he was much more afraid of
the awful, new thing down in the
valley.  But his wits soon came
back to him.  He told the walrus
that, of course, he would gladly
obey his command; and he immediately
started off at a brisk trot
toward the burning tree.  He kept
on in that direction for about a
hundred yards, and then, reaching
a thicket of alders, he skipped in
among the twisted stems, changed
his course, and ran for fully a mile
in a great half-circle.  That brought
him out on a hilltop at a safe
distance from both the fire and the
walrus, and yet in sight of both.
Then he sat down comfortably to
see what would happen.
</p>

<p>
"Well, as the wood burned away,
and fell to coals and ashes, the great
fire in the valley became smaller
and smaller.  Night grew dark
over all the wilderness, save where
the sparks broke from the bursting
timber and the mouths of several
of the men-folk's caves shone red
with the little fires within.
</p>

<p>
"'See, it gets smaller and
smaller, every minute,' said King
Walrus to his people.  It is but a
poor creature, after all, and will
soon be dead.  It is nothing but
some foolish little magic of the
miserable two-legged people.'
</p>

<p>
"Then a wolf said, 'Yes, it
may die, but I think it has cubs in
every one of the frightened people's
dens.  And they will grow, quick
as water running over a stone, and
they, too, may have many cubs.'
</p>

<p>
"At last the flames ceased to
dance at all on the ashes of the
dead spruce tree, and the watching
animals could see only a few red
spots here and there.  Hours went
by, and still they sat on every hilltop
overlooking the valley, howling and
snarling and roaring, and staring
with their wide, yellow eyes.  At
last they could see no sign of life at
all in the fire.  Then they shouted,
one to another, that the terrible
creature was dead; and a number
of the bravest of them&mdash;three
walruses, and several bears and
wolves&mdash;stole down to see what kind of
a dinner the body would make.
That is what they were always
thinking about everything&mdash;how
it would feel in their stomachs.
</p>

<p>
On the way down to the valley,
a bear and a walrus pushed
against each other and immediately
began to fight.  Soon the
smell of blood was strong in the
air, and all the animals that had
started down to try to eat the dead
body of the fire tried to eat one
another instead.  Two great bears,
with their claws and their teeth
deep in each other's hides, went
rolling down a steep side of a hill
straight into the coals and ashes of
the spruce tree.  Of course the
fire was not dead!  There was a
great bed of hot, red coals under
the ashes.  Little flames sprang
up around the bodies of the fighting
bears, and began to eat the long,
thick coats of fur.  The bears felt
the awful stings, and quickly let go
of each other and scrambled to
their feet.  Their backs and sides
were smarting and their noses and
paws were terribly blistered.  They
saw the red and yellow coals all
about them, blinking and shining
like the eyes of wicked devils&mdash;and
their hearts melted with fear.
Away they ran, howling and roaring,
with the flames leaping high
on their backs.  It was a frightful
sight.  The animals that saw it, all
dashed away to their dens, fearing
that the dreadful red creatures
might chase them and spring upon
their backs as they had sprung upon
the backs of the fighting bears.
Even old King Walrus went heaving
and lumbering away, and hid between
two hummocks of rock.  As
for the unfortunate bears who had
rolled into the fire, they ran straight
ahead, without caring or seeing or
thinking where they were running
to.  They were blind with terror
and mad with pain.  They ran and
ran until at last one of them fell
into Beaver River and the other
into Black Fox Pond.  Of course
the water killed the fire on their
backs and sides, but for a long
time they just swam around and
around in the cold water.  At last,
though they still smarted and ached
all over, they knew that the terrible
creatures had gone away from
them.  So they swam ashore&mdash;one
to the bank of the river and one to
the bank of the pond&mdash;and ran
seaward as hard as they could.
All they thought about was the
quickest way of getting out of that
terrible country.
</p>

<br>
&quot;Away they ran, howling and roaring&quot;
</p>

<p>
"Now it happened that Porcupine
Killer and the other men of
the tribe knew nothing about the
trouble of the two bears and the
fright which all the other animals
had received.  If they had known
they would have felt very happy.
They had heard more howls and
yells and roars than usual, but did
not know what the trouble was.
When Porcupine Killer awoke he
fed the coals of his fire with sticks
of dry wood, and broiled several
slices of caribou meat for breakfast.
He was very merry, and could not
help singing when he thought of
how life had changed since the
morning before.  Now he and his
wife and baby, and nearly every one
in the tribe, had food to eat, and a
warmth like sunlight in their caves,
and a friend that struck terror to
the hearts of the fierce animals.
His wife awoke at the noise of his
song (for he was not a very fine
singer) and she, too, was happy as
soon as the fog of sleep had passed
from her mind and she remembered
the wonderful thing that had
happened.  After they had eaten,
Porcupine Killer said, 'I am going
out to frighten the animals
again&mdash;and to-day they shall be frightened
more than they were yesterday.
This wonderful thing that dances
and whispers so peacefully on the
floor of our cave is greater than all
the fangs and claws and tusks of
all the animals in the world.  And
it is my friend&mdash;the friend of the
tribe.  I shall hunt old King
Walrus himself, and cause him to
repent of the evil he has done.'
</p>

<p>
"The woman begged him not
to be rash.  The giant animals
had ruled the country so long, and
hunted men as men hunt hares and
foxes now, that she could not believe
that anything was stronger than the
animals.  But Porcupine Killer had
no fear, since he had seen the
power of the fire.  He looked out
of the mouth of the cave, and saw
the ashes of the fire lying black
and gray on the rocky ground.  He
looked all around the sides of the
valley, lying quiet in the brightness
of the autumn morning, and could
not see so much as a skulking fox.
He crawled out and looked to the
right and left, at the holes in the
rocky hillside where so many of
his own people lived.  He saw
little wisps of smoke rising here
and there from among the boulders
and from the mouths of some of
the caves.  He shouted for the
hidden warriors to come out.
Winter Morning, the chief, and
Broken Arrow were the first to
appear.  Porcupine Killer called
to them that he was going on a
great hunt, and that they should
see wonderful things happen
before the sun had reached the top
of the sky.
</p>

<p>
"'We saw many wonders yesterday,
great Magician,' said Winter
Morning.  'What new wonders
will you show us to-day?'
</p>

<p>
"'I am not a magician,' replied
Porcupine Killer, who was an
honest young man.  'But the wonder
you shall see to-day will be the
hunting of the fierce animals that
have hunted us since the beginning
of time.'
</p>

<p>
"Six warriors joined Porcupine
Killer in front of his cave.  They
looked at every hill and wood and
rock, but could not see one of their
enemies.  'We are the masters of
the world,' said Porcupine Killer.
He took a burning stick in his
hand, from his own fire, and led
the warriors to the other side of
the little valley.  They passed the
long heap of dead ashes and coals,
where the tree had burned the night
before.  The ashes were still
warm, and deep in the middle of
the mass a few coals were still alive.
At the far side of the valley they
threw together a great heap of dry
bushes and moss and fallen logs.
To this Porcupine Killer set a
flame from the torch in his hand;
and in a minute it was crackling
and breathing and blazing, and
lifting clouds of black smoke into the
air.  Then each warrior took a
blazing stick from the heap, and
again Porcupine Killer led them
forward.  They had not gone far
before two wolves sprang from a
grove of spruces in front of them
and went galloping away.  At that,
the warriors shouted and laughed,
and waved their blazing sticks.  It
made them feel great and brave to
see the very same beasts that were
in the habit of hunting them turn
tail and run at the sight of them.
They went up to the top of the hill
and there built another fire in a
rocky place.  And so they moved
forward over hills and hummocks
and barrens, and through patches
of dark forest, sending all manner
of animals fleeing before them.
Here and there they built and lit
new fires, to protect their homeward
trail; but Porcupine Killer
chose the places for these fires with
great care.  'It does not eat rocks,'
he said.  So all the fires were
made on rocky places, away from
trees and bushes.  Porcupine Killer
had a thought in the back of his
head that it would not be wise for
all the forests in the country to be
devoured by this wonderful new
creature.
</p>

<p>
"At last the warriors came upon
old King Walrus himself, lying
sound asleep in a narrow valley
between two small hills.  He was
all alone, for his followers had
deserted him during the night.
Porcupine Killer made a sign to his
companions to be very quiet.  They
hid along the crest of one of the
hills, above the great, round back
of King Walrus.  Then Porcupine
Killer gathered a huge armful
of dry moss and twigs, set it
alight with his torch, and threw it
down upon the walrus's back.
Then, standing on a high rock and
waving his torch so that the smoke
and sparks flew thick and fast, he
shouted, 'Wake up, old blubbersides,
and return to your own
country!  Wake up and see the
Red Spirit sitting on your back!'
</p>

<p>
"Through his heavy, troubled
dreams old King Walrus heard the
voice and felt a horrible sting in his
fat back.  He lifted his huge head
and cast one glance at Porcupine
Killer and the flaming stick.  He
felt the teeth of the terrible red
creature, and knew that it had
caught him in his sleep.  With a
bellow of terror that nearly
deafened the hidden warriors, he
floundered out of the valley and
travelled seaward as fast as he
could go."
</p>

<p>
Squat-by-the-fire puffed hard at
her pipe, and stared into the fire.
</p>

<p>
"Did he get home?" asked
Flying Plover.
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  He reached the sea, and
dashed into the deep water, and
swam straight home to his lands of
ice and snow," replied the old
woman.
</p>

<p>
"And what did Porcupine
Killer do?" asked the little boy.
</p>

<p>
"He went home, too, and cooked
a fine caribou steak for his dinner."
</p>

<p>
"Did all the animals run out of
the country?"
</p>

<p>
"No.  In time they lost some of
their fear of the fire.  But they
were always afraid to go very close
to it."
</p>

<p>
"When were the animals made
as small as they are now?"
</p>

<p>
"That belongs to another story.
If I tell you any more now, my
brain will split and the skin will
come off my throat again," replied
the old woman.

<br><br>
ANOTHER STORY OF GLUSKAP AND HIS PEOPLE
</h3>

<p>
"A time came when the great
animals in Gluskap's own country
broke the good rules he had made
for them," began old Squat-by-the-fire.
"They were so big and
strong, and had become so
accustomed to seeing Gluskap in the
form of a small young man, that
they forgot how powerful he was.
They were by nature fierce and
bloodthirsty, though they had
hidden the evil deep in their hearts
for many years.  The trouble was
started by a great wolf.  He stuck
his head into a man's lodge and
glared at the man's children until
they all began to cry with fright.
Then the man was angry, and
struck the wolf on the snout with
a club.  At that, the wolf caught
the man between his cruel jaws
and killed him.  The taste of the
human blood awoke all the evil
that had been sleeping for so long
in his heart.  Then he ran about
the country, chasing men and
women and every animal smaller
or weaker than himself, and killing
many of them.  At sight of that
all the other wolves and fierce
animals felt a madness in their brains,
and began to hunt and kill.  Gluskap
left his lodge at the noise and
looked about him with eyes that
could see for the distance of a four
days' journey.  At sight of the
blood and the hunting beasts he
was filled with anger.  By his
magic he made himself as high as
a mountain.  Then he caught the
animals in his great hands,
reaching here and there after them,
across hills and valleys; and as he
returned each animal to the ground
it was as small as its kind is to-day.
And this he did all over the world;
and from that day to this the
animals have no more been masters of
the wilderness.  Then he led the
men and women and children of
the tribe, who had been in his care
for so many years, far away to a
country of thick forest and broad
rivers&mdash;a finer country, I have
heard, than even this land of ours.
There they built villages and
prospered, and for many hundreds of
years Gluskap continued to be as
a father to them."
</p>

<p>
"What did his people do, in
their fine new country?" asked
Flying Plover.
</p>

<p>
"They did many things," replied
the old woman.  "I have heard
from Micmacs on the coast that in
time there came to be many
magicians in that country.  Some of
the magic was good, such as Gluskap
himself knew; and some was
bad&mdash;and that was practiced by
his enemies.  Yes, he had many
enemies&mdash;evil people who hated
him because he always fought
against evil."
</p>

<p>
"Please tell me something about
the magic," begged the little boy.
</p>

<p>
The old medicine woman thought
for a long time, and scratched her
head very hard.
</p>

<p>
"I know only one story about
the magic of Gluskap's people&mdash;and
I am not sure if it is a true
story or not, for I heard it from a
Micmac fisherman on the coast,"
she said.
</p>

<p>
"Long ago, in the country of
Gluskap's people&mdash;the new country
to which he had led them from the
barren lands&mdash;there lived three
boys in one big lodge.  They were
the sons of the chief of the village.
One day, while they were at play
in the woods at some distance from
their father's lodge, they heard a
sudden squeak and a sound of
struggling in a nearby thicket.
They ran swiftly to the place, and
were in time to save a little brown
hare from the hunger of a wildcat.
They beat the wildcat with sticks
until it sprang away.  They carried
the wounded hare to their lodge,
and there washed and dressed its
hurts.  In a day or two it was
able to hop about the lodge.  One
morning, when the father and
mother were fishing in the river, the
hare spoke to the children with a
human voice.  'My friends,' it said,
'to-day I must journey far to the
northward, on Gluskap's business.
For your kindness to me each of
you shall receive a magic gift.  I
shall name the gifts, so each can
make his choice, and to-night you
will find them at the door of your
lodge.'  The boys were dumb with
wonder, for they knew that the little
brown hare must be a great
magician.  'First,' the hare continued,
'are the moccasins of the wind.
With these on his feet a man can
run above the tree-tops, on the
currents of the air.  Second, is the
wallet of plenty.  With this at his
belt, a man will never lack either
food or water.  The third gift is
an arrow of red wood, feathered
with red and barbed with yellow
metal.'
</p>

<p>
"The oldest boy chose the
moccasins of the wind.  The second
in age said that the wallet of plenty
seemed a fine thing to him.  So
the youngest got the red arrow.
Then the hare hopped away into
the bushes; and at night the three
gifts lay by the door of the lodge.
The seasons passed.  The boy
who possessed the moccasins of
the wind became a great hunter and
warrior.
</p>

<p>
"When he was twenty years of
age he was made chief of the village.
His lodge was spread deep with
the pelts of wolves and bears and
foxes.  He was a great man&mdash;and
all owing to the virtue of the magic
moccasins.  But he did not always
remember that.  He was full of
pride.  The second brother grew
sleek, and slow of wit.  Cooked
food and fresh water were always at
his side, so he was content to sit still.
But the youngest of the brothers
was neither famous nor lazy.  He
was a brave fighter, but he led no
war parties.  He was a good
hunter and worked hard for his
living.  He could find no magic in
the red arrow, though he had put
it to many tests.  It shot no
straighter and flew no farther than
the other shafts in his quiver.  But
he always kept it near him, ready
for whatever might happen, for his
faith in its virtue was strong.
</p>

<p>
"One day in early autumn the
young man with the red arrow left
the village of his people.  Something
had spoken to him in his sleep,
and had told him that a great
adventure awaited him in a far
country.  So he journeyed northward
and westward, by whatever trails
came most readily to his feet.
Game was plenty, so he did not
want for food.  On the evening of
the third day of his journey he
came to the edge of a great barren.
It spread before him, treeless from
horizon to horizon.  But a little
voice in his brain told him that his
way led straight on.
</p>

<p>
"After he had traveled over that
great barren for more than two
days he saw a line of blue hills far
to the north.  While he was still
many miles distant from them he
caught sight of something running
swiftly toward him.  As it drew
near him he saw, greatly to his
wonder, that it was a young woman.
Her eyes were bright with terror,
and she ran unsteadily over the
rough ground.  When she saw the
young man she swerved in her
course and ran to him, crying out
that a terrible wizard followed her
in the form of a great bear.  The
youth set an arrow to the string of
his bow; and, as he waited for the
bear to appear, the girl told him
that he who hunted her was the
most powerful of all the evil wizards,
and that he could take upon himself
at pleasure the form of any
bird or animal.
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-117"></a>
<br>
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-117.jpg" alt="Suddenly the great bear appeared, galloping heavily">
<br>
Suddenly the great bear appeared, galloping heavily
</p>

<p>
"Suddenly the great bear
appeared, galloping heavily but
swiftly.  Its small eyes burned with
ferocity.  Its narrow, scarlet tongue
hung from its jaws.  As the youth
drew his bow he noticed that the
red arrow was the one he had
chanced to draw from his belt.  He
loosed it straight at the shoulder of
the advancing beast.  It flashed
from the string and vanished.  The
bear advanced.  The young brave
trembled, and the girl cried out in
dismay.  But in a second the red
arrow fell at its master's feet, and
across its haft hung the moccasins
of the wind.  In a flash the young
man understood.  He tore his own
moccasins from his feet and
replaced them with the magic pair.
Then he returned the red arrow to
his quiver and caught the girl in
his arms.  She felt no heavier than
a young fox, so great was the magic
of the moccasins.
</p>

<p>
"'Have no fear,' he said, and
sprang away.  Under his speeding
feet the earth swam back and
melted behind them, and the gray,
brown, blue, and red of its tinted
surface mixed like colored waters.
For a thousand miles the wizard
followed, now with the stride of a
moose, now with the wings of an
eagle; but he was left so far behind
in the first half-second that he lost
both scent and sight of them before
the magic moccasins had made a
dozen strides.  So you may believe
that at the end of his thousand
miles he was very far on the wrong
trail.  When the young man paused
to take breath he found that floors
and heaps of ice stretched away
on all sides.  The air was bitterly
cold.  Overhead the dome of
heaven was alive with the
magnificent, drifting radiance of the
Northern Lights.  The girl lay
weakly against his arm, for the
speed of their flight had held her
breath in her nostrils.  Presently
she opened her eyes and looked
about her fearfully.
</p>

<p>
"'How came we to this place?' she asked.
</p>

<p>
"'By the magic of the moccasins
of the wind,' he told her,
pointing down at the gaily beaded
shoes on his feet.
</p>

<p>
"She trembled and hid her face.
'It was like death,' she said.
</p>

<p>
"Then the youth understood that
to endure the tremendous flight of
the moccasins one must also be
possessed of their strength.  For hours
they wandered about in search of
shelter and food.  In unhurried
motion the young man's feet
experienced none of the magic.  He was
thankful for that.  At last the girl
sank on the ice, faint for want of
food and drink.  Then the man
bethought him of the red arrow, and,
fitting it to his bow, fired it at a
distance.
</p>

<p>
"'Its virtue is so great,' he
thought, 'that it may bring a fowl
or a fish to me, to keep this woman
from death.'  In a second the
arrow was at his feet, and midway
on the red shaft hung the wallet of
plenty.  Thankfully they ate and
drank, and hearts and bodies
recovered strength.
</p>

<p>
"Many moons later the possessor
of the red arrow, accompanied
by the beautiful young woman,
approached the lodges of his own
people.  At his belt, securely
wrapped in water-tight skins, he
carried the moccasins of the wind
and the wallet of plenty.  He was
an honest man, and wished to
return them to the rightful owners
uninjured.  A mile from the
village they met the second brother&mdash;the
man who had chosen the wallet
of plenty from among the three
gifts.  Upon his shoulders he
carried a great stick of maple-wood.
In appearance he had changed
surprisingly since the other's departure.
The muscles stood out on his lean
arms and legs, and his eyes were
merry; whereas of old his limbs
had been heavy with fat and his eyes dull.
</p>

<p>
"'Why do you carry that great
log?' asked the wanderer, after
they had exchanged brotherly greetings.
</p>

<p>
"'To split and store away, for the
making of paddles and arrow-shafts
in the stormy days of winter,'
replied the other.
</p>

<p>
"The wanderer handed him the
wallet of plenty&mdash;but, upon
opening it, they found that it was empty.
</p>

<p>
"''Tis better so,' remarked the
maker of paddles, as he hoisted
the stick of maple back to his
shoulders.
</p>

<p>
"At the outskirts of the village,
in a modest wigwam, the young
couple found the eldest of the three
brothers, the man who had chosen
the moccasins of the wind.  He
was lying on a couch of skins, and
his children played about the door.
His greeting was modest and
kindly.  But he could not rise from
his couch to welcome them.
</p>

<p>
"'In my pride,' he said, 'I
forgot that my prowess in the chase
and the battle was all of the magic
moccasins.  I thought myself the
very equal of Gluskap.  But the
moccasins flew away from me, and
in the next hunt I was stricken to
the earth by a wounded moose&mdash;for
I was no stronger than the youngest
warrior and no swifter than the
oldest chief.'
</p>

<p>
"The new-comer produced the
moccasins of the wind from the bag
at his side, and gave them into the
hands of the fallen chieftain.  At
that moment a tall stranger entered
the wigwam and took the moccasins
from his hands.  Then, turning to
the other, he took the red arrow
from the quiver.  Already the
wallet of plenty hung at his belt of
blue wampum.
</p>

<p>
"'The three gifts were equal in
the sight of Gluskap,' he said, 'but
you see how you have driven their
magic to the desires of your own
hearts.  Only the red arrow worked
to its full power, and in doing so it
has doubled its magic.  Now
Gluskap has need of it, and takes it
back as a gift from this young
man.'  He turned, and glided from the
lodge."
</p>

<p>
"Who was it?" asked Flying Plover.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know; but perhaps it
was Gluskap himself," replied the
old woman.
</p>

<p>
"Do you know any more stories
about the red arrow?" asked the boy.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps I do," said the old
woman.  "But I'll not tell you
any more to-night."

distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

provided that:

        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue

        works.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
